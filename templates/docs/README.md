# Docs

Canonical documentation for this repo. Every other harness path (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot/`) holds a one-line pointer here, never a copy.

Each folder below is defined by its **class** — its update rule — not by its topic. Topic tells you what a doc is about; class tells you what you are allowed to do to it, and that is the property that decays when it is left unstated.

## Contents

| Folder | Class | Update rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture/` | `living` | Edit in place the moment reality changes. Never append dated entries. Every file carries a `verify:` command. |
| `docs/decisions/` | `ledger` | Append-only. One file per decision, `NNNN-slug.md`. Correct a decision by adding a new one that supersedes it — never by editing the original. |
| `docs/stories/` | `flow` | One file per unit of work. Mutable while active; move to `docs/stories/done/` when it reaches `done` or `dropped`. |
| `docs/stories/done/` | `flow` | Archive. Read-only in practice. Nothing here is in flight. |
| `docs/changelog/` | `ledger` | Append-only. Every entry needs a date, an author, and a `### Why`. |
| `docs/research/` | `ledger` | Append-only. Dated findings, filename `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`. Superseded research is marked, not deleted. |

Top-level `CONTEXT.md` (`living`) is the glossary. Top-level `AGENTS.md` (`living`) is the router.

## Frontmatter contract

Every doc in this tree carries:

```yaml
---
id: <stable-slug>
class: living|ledger|flow
status: <per table>
owner: "@handle"
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---
```

| class | valid `status` | extra required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| living | `current` | `verify:` |
| ledger | `accepted` / `superseded` / `reverted` | `date:` |
| flow | `backlog` / `active` / `blocked` / `done` / `dropped` | — |

`id` is stable: it never changes, even when the title does. `owner` is never blank — the audit behind this kit found zero documents across 22 project folders carrying a date, version, or owner, so nothing was anyone's job and nothing got fixed.

`verify:` is the anti-stale lever and must be a command or a concrete check, not a sentiment. The audit found a README claiming manual sync against an ApplicationSet configured for automated prune and selfHeal; a `verify` of `grep syncPolicy bootstrap/*.yaml` would have caught it in one command.

## Three rules that override everything

1. **Nothing durable is gitignored.** Two audited repos hid their only real planning doc behind `.gitignore`; both rotted unreviewed.
2. **Docs point at config; they never copy it.** Reference `file:line`. The audit found one manifest stored in three places and a duplicate metrics table that already disagreed with its source at different precision.
3. **One canonical path, thin per-harness pointers.** The best architecture doc in the audit lived under `.github/copilot/skills/`, a path Claude Code and OMP never load.

## Adding a doc

1. Pick the class first. If you cannot name the update rule, you do not yet know where the doc goes.
2. Copy the matching template, fill the frontmatter completely, and replace every `<angle-bracket>` placeholder — including `updated:`. A literal `YYYY-MM-DD` left in prose is a defect the audit caught in a real changelog's backup paths.
3. Link it from the nearest index: architecture from `docs/architecture/overview.md`, everything else from this file's table.
